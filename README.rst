Welcome to micro-mouse robots land !
===================================

On this page you will learn how we designed our robots.

How does the high level C code communicate with the micro-controller
and other hardware components ?

How do we manage to bring the micro-mouses at the right speed and in the right direction
at each step all along the way ?

How do we manage to detect obstacles ?

Those are only a few examples of all the questions that will we will addressed here :-)
