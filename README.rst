Welcome to the micro-mouse robots project
=========================================

.. topic:: Abstract

   On this page you will learn how we designed our robots.

   * How does the high level C code communicate with the micro-controller
     and other hardware components ?
   * How do we manage to bring the micro-mouses at the right speed and in the right direction
     at each step all along the way ?
   * How do we manage to detect obstacles ?

   Those are only a few examples of all the questions that will we will addressed here :-)
